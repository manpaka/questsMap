          What are the West Marches?
        </h2>
        <div class="medium-text">
          <ul>
            <li>A West Marches campaign is a sandbox game. All adventures are opt in, most sessions don’t connect to each other, and most plot hooks are created by the players through Missions.</li>
            <li>There is no regular schedule. Every session is scheduled by the players.</li>
            <li>Each session has different party members from the larger group. There is normally a limit on how many can play based on the session and DM.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          Rules and Guidelines
        </h2>
        <div class="medium-text">
          <p>Here are some general guidelines to the Confederation Marches.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Follow the Discord community guidelines. [Listed on the Discord server]</li>
            <li>Adventures do not happen in the main town. This is to avoid logistical problems.</li>
            <li>When a session ends, the party returns to the main town and rejoins the larger group.</li>
            <li>Players cannot be in the exact same party multiple sessions in a row.</li>
            <li>Players can have up to two characters if they want. </li>
            <ul>
              <li>But you can only have 1 character in an adventure at a time. </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Leveling up is done through group xp. Completing adventures gives group xp equal to adventure level. All characters are always the same level. </li>
            <li>At the end of an adventure your character always receives a point of inspiration. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          Missions
        </h2>
        <div class="medium-text">
          <h4>What are Missions?</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Missions are session plot hooks made by players.</li>
            <li>The setting up a mission goes like this:</li>
            <ol>
              <li>Starts with a player character wanting to do something outside of the home base.</li>
              <li>Player sends some basic information to me, and we set up a mission posting. </li>
              <li>The player character forms a party with others along with getting a DM and scheduled session.</li>
              <li>The DM takes the mission and sets up the session.</li>
              <li>The session starts with the party leaving homebase and doing the mission.</li>
              <li>The session ends with the party heading back to the homebase.</li>
              <li>Players write up recaps and the party disbands.</li>
            </ol>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="medium-text">
          <h4>The rules and guidelines for missions.</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The DM is the one to choose the level of the missions.</li>
            <li>Each player can only have 1 active mission posting at a time.</li>
            <li>The level of the mission is based on the rewards, party size, and monsters encountered on the mission.</li>
            <li>Mission should not be too grand in scope (ex. Villain is going to blow up the town). This is normally up to DM discretion.</li>
          </ul>
          When a mission’s scope is too big it’ll be split up into several missions that are connected to each other. For Example:
          <ul>
            <li>A character wants to find their missing brother and posts a quest for it.</li>
            <li>The DM then decides that it is too early (They are level 4 or something) and the character probably should not find their brother in this quest. They then make the quest reward a clue towards the brother’s potential location instead.
            </li>
            <li>Then the player posts another new quest with the added detail that they know where to go this time.</li>
            <li>The session ends with the party learning that the brother was murdered and they head back to town.</li>
            <li>The character then posts another quest that is about searching for the murderer.</li>
            <li>And this “adventure” can go on for a while. But, it is good for DM’s to know when to stop. Normally this is up to discretion and level of the player character.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          Advice for DMs
        </h2>
        <div class="medium-text">
          <ul>
            <li>You are writing a one session adventure. It’s alright if adventures need to be extended, but do not plan for them to be longer beforehand. Ideally a narrative break in between sessions is added so players can switch around.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If you run overtime and a second session is necessary, schedule a part 2.</li>
              <li>While characters are between session parts 1 & 2 they should not join other adventures. This is to avoid continuity problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Adventures need to be self contained.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>A little bit of railroading is not only okay, but expected.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Especially with Missions suggested by players, keep to the plot! Players should make measurable progress toward the stated goal.</li>
            <li>The rewards for adventures (if it’s not a hunt for specific items) are determined by the random treasure tables based on adventure level.</li>
            <li>Do not benefit your own characters while dming (barring things like group xp)</li>
            <li>Do not have your own characters join a session you are dming. </li>

          <h4>What are Recaps?</h4>
          <p>When a session finishes one or more players can write up a session recap for the community to read. When a recap is posted the player character is given a reward of gold or items based on the session and level.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Only one recap per player, per session.</li>
            <li>If a recap is written in character, the player gets a better reward.</li>
