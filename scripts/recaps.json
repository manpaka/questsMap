        "Content": "Cambyses, Decax, and Sander found themselves in a mysterious and dark land. After getting their barings, they walked up to a set of gates nearby and talked with the burgomaster of Krezk, Dimitri. told to go to the vineyard to see why there were no more shipments of wine coming into the village. If they discover what happened then maybe they&#39;d be let into the village.<br><br>The three go southwards to the Wizard of the Wines winery. They engaged a cult of insane druids at the winery, the cult had infested the winery with Blights using what is known as a Gulthias Staff. Soon the three were joined by an early arrival, Stormfang. After ridding the building of the blights, they noticed a larger force coming in from the south. As they prepared for a fight, Cambyses discovered that the staff, upon being broken in half, would instantly kill all blights within 500ft of it with an ear piercing scream. To which the Tiefling snapped the staff on one of the building roofs.<br><br>But while that was happening, something else was going on.<br><br>After a long journey five adventurers; Areyja, Hadrian, Stormfang, Kipna, Professor Wynather, and the giant owl Lilkip turned a corner to see the village of Krezk in the distance. It was midday and Hadrian&#39;s vision saw the unknown figures approaching the village in the evening. While moving towards the village, Stormfang is grabbed and carried away by one of the Wareravens they had previously met outside of Vallaki, Adrian Martikov. Soon the entire party was grabbed, Kipna jumped onto Lilkip mid-flight, and Hadrian had already started using his staff to follow along. The group was brought to a large Vineyard, known as The Wizard of the Wines. stormfang had arrived early to aid in the battle while the rest of the group had arrived at the very end, and there were some new faces at the vineyard.<br><br>The two groups soon converged and began had a discussion on their next course of action, along with a couple methods of taming the large amount of ravens in the winery. Hadrian soon flew off to tell the martikovs that their winery had been cleaned out, along with that he got some info about the Crawling Hut of the Witch, which he saw in the distance... Hadrian soon got back the group and they continue to talk about ravens, but they were cut off when they noticed that areyja was missing. They started to look for the bard, a couple of them noticed that she was out westward, running into the forest.<br><br>Areyja had seen someone she knew and began chasing after the supposed apparition. The party chased after her, except Cambyses who was helping the Martikovs with cleaning. Soon they stopped her deep into the forest, to which they saw an oddity, Areyja saw the instrument of her teacher, Decax saw the body of juice, Sander saw the ashes of the wolf snarl, Kipna saw the body of Lil Kip, and Hadrian saw a small meat pie. Stormfang and the Professor saw the illusion for what it was, a deep hole. Which closed immediately after the Professor poked it with a stick. Ending the illusion.<br><br>The party had soon gone back to the winery. Areyja was rather quiet for most of the journey, as Stormfang had aggressively held her back from grabbing the illusory instrument. There were now a couple options on what to do next,<ul><li>Go to the berez and look for a supposed item that can aid them in Barovia,</li><li>Go back to krezk for safety with a shipment of wine, or</li><li>Fight the wandering tree,</li></ul>The party then decided to fight the tree. (After a long conversation about raven taming)<br><br>They soon started their journey, Areyja stayed silent during this time, and Hadrian kept track of the crawling tree. The party then split ways with the Martikov wine cart and headed south east. After some time, they noticed that the tree was climbing the hill up ahead. They climbed the hill and soon saw the tree stop at the center of the grass covered hilltop. The group then approached the tree and saw the clearly lit front door, which Stormfang, Decax, and Sander immediately went into as the others stayed outside ready for a fight.<br><br>Inside the tree, Stormfang noticed a shelf with a large tome on it. He grabbed the book; the tree suddenly became active as the door slams shut. Outside of the tree, the party watched as the door slammed shut and the tree uprooted itself. As panic set in, a massive ring of red light appeared around the tree. Looking outside of the ring, a couple dozen ghostly blue humanoid forms appeared and low melodic sounds started to hum in the breeze.<br><br><span class='text-black-50'>The night is setting in, and it will be a long night...</span>"

        "Date": "January 2nd",
        "Content": "On top of a hill the party was split into two, three were inside the hut with the other five outside. At a distance, a massive blue ring of ethereal fire surrounded the tree and party. On the outside of the ring, standing firm, were around two dozen ghostly apparitions. The tree, at that moment, did not seem to be that much of a threat. Inside the tree, in the hut, there were several notable items on a shelf behind glass;<ul><li>Large tome (which had already been grabbed by Stormfang)</li><li>An acorn sitting in an egg holder</li><li>Some random broom</li><li>Couple heads and helmets</li><li>A couple unspeakable items (too disgusting to describe)</li><li>And, a small stone statue of an unknown figure standing in a flat pose</li></ul>The tree had not attacked until Sander Rainpath grabbed the acorn from the shelf. This action caused the tree to retaliate by growing a long lance-like branch that pierced Sander through the chest at a violent speed, severely wounding him. The tree then proceeded to shoot more branches and roots with the same speed directly at the rest of the party. Some dodged the shots while others shielded themselves, Areyja soon became shielded by Lil-kip, who had already been using his wings to defend some of the other party members. Decax had tried to escape the tree only to find that the door had merged into the wall leaving them with no way out.<br><br>The most odd thing during the fight was that whenever the tree would move, the circle of fire would follow, this kept the tree in the center. The most worrying thing was that the ring of blue flame would shrink with each movement.<br><br>Decax started to stab the now false door in an attempt to break out of the hut in the tree. Meanwhile, Sander held the acorn grabbed off the shelf and he believed that it was important to the tree, then and there, he took his battleaxe and swung down at the acorn. Upon the acorn being damaged, the tree would take damage doubled. This action had made the tree become even more aggressive towards the party, especially towards the ones inside the tree. Stormfang started to attack the floor using the dwarven axe Hew, the floor was just the cross section of the tree and not hardwood panels. Learning this, Stormfang joined Sander and attacked the acorn which brought the tree to the brink of defeat. Utilizing several holes forming in the side, Stormfang jumped out of the tree. Then, with its final breath, the tree stabbed Sander Rainpath with multiple spikes through the body, knocking the Fibolg unconscious. What had dealt the final blow to the tree was the spell moonbeam cast by Decax. The tree had begun to fall apart and bury the hut inside of it, Cambyses ran into the hut and pulled an unconscious Sander out of it with Decax behind carrying the broom and Sander&#39;s axe.<br><br>The fight had drained the party but they had finally defeated the tree, as it collapsed into a pile of rotting wood and blood red sap. Despite the victory the circle of blue flame did not go away. The ghostly figures on the outside of the ring had now become properly visible, all of them were dressed in ruined plate armor and battle wounds. The ghosts were only observing the battle but it's unknown what they were there for. The party collected themselves in the blue ring and spent a couple minutes identifying the items. Learning that the acorn was a magical seed that would bring life to what it was planted in. The broom was just a normal broom. They also, discovered that Kipna has been carrying a statue known as the Icon of Ravenloft for some time now. After the discoveries, Stormfang started to read the tome that had started this. He had gotten to the end of the first half but was quickly interrupted by a loud guttural screaming sound. The ring of blue flame dispersed and the ghosts scattering into the ether, leaving the party in the dark. Areyja saw, at a distance, a wolf with glowing red eyes approaching the party. She informed the others and they all quickly prepared for a fight as Decax moved forward and was attacked by a number of zombies climbing out of the earth, and the wolf morphed into a humanoid form that was recognized as the vampire lord of Barovia, strahd. Strahd charmed a wounded Decax and began to approach the Tabaxi to stop him from reading the tome. Stormfang jumped onto Hadrian&#39;s flying staff and flew away but was interrupted as Strahd shot Stormfang with a fireball, injuring Stormfang but not stopping him. The party continued the fight but upon Cambyses taking the first shot at Strahd immediately killed the vampire. This action confused the party, until the vampire&#39;s body morphed into a common human and the zombies immediately fell apart. Both fights had really hurt the party, but the fight was over and they have been rejuvenated with the info they have been given by the tome they had acquired.<br><br><span class='text-black-50'>The party is now more powerful but the fight is going to get harder from here...</span>"

        "Date": "January 16th and 23rd",
        "Content": "The evening sets in as the party rests for the night. Upon the sun rising and poking through the clouds the party buried the bodies. The group had mourned the unknown dead and stayed in the field for some time. Investigating the area had shown that several stones and rocks around the field are tombstones. The field is an ancient battlefield turned graveyard.<br><br>They then decided to head towards the nearby ruins of Berez to continue following their lead to some sort of holy symbol. The hill descended downwards to a low marsh area with several ruins peaking through the heavily moss covered plane. Hadrian, Professor Wynather, and Areyja stay at the top of the field as the rest of the group heads down the hill. As the party starts to move onto the moss Stormfang, who immediately sinks into a hidden sinkhole. He becomes encased under several feet of silt and water and about to drown only to be pulled out from the sinkhole by the party. This showed the party that the field is covered in a large amount of hidden sinkholes that could result in a creature getting trapped under the ground. There were two buildings visible, half sunken into the moss field, a large building in the center of the field and a large tower in the distance. The group split into three teams; Stormfang and Kipna went to a small ruin nearby, Decax and Sander moved toward the large building in the center of the field, and Cambyses stayed behind to ritually cast the spell detect magic. Sander and Decax, while moving towards the manor, ended up finding themselves in a sudden sinkhole. Decax quickly saved Sander using magical grasping roots. Sander, being able to talk with animals, asks a small group of Skinks to help the two continue onwards without falling into any other sinkholes.<br><br>Stormfang and Kipna investigate a small ruin poking out of the moss. They discovered that the ruins, which are barely poking out of the moss, could be potentially over three floors tall. Cam stood nearby as his detect magic spell finished. During which Areyja came down the hill to meet up with Cambyses, Stormfang and Kipna. Areyja was pointed towards the tower in the far distance. She used her Fochlucan Bandore to cast the spell fly and she flew towards the tower. As Areyja was flying towards the tower Decax and Sander arrived at the large manor in the center of the ruins. The two then began to enter the building and saw, at the floor that they had access to, there was a noticeable water stream flowing downwards to a potential basement. Cambyses, after finishing his ritual cast of detect magic, caught up with Sander and Decax at the large building. The three entered the building. As they followed the flowing water stream, Cambyses smelt a familiar scent of smoke and entered a room that brought memories of his old life in Baldur&#39;s Gate. Cambyses ran out of the building into the open air, being followed by Sander and Decax. The three were soon joined by Stormfang, Kipna and Lil-kip. Stormfang had gotten a message from Areyja.<br><br>Areyja had arrived at the tower, it looked like a watch tower of some kind that had sunk several floors into the ground. Areyja, being able to fly, landed on the top floor balcony. She saw that there was a large nest with a single egg in the center. Upon inspection she concluded that it is either a Gryffon nest or hippogriff nest. She floated above the nest to get to the door across the room, along with grabbing a potion that was visibly sitting in the nest among other trinkets and bones. Before she began going down the stairs beyond the doorway she used her limited ability to cast the spell Sending and contacted Stormfang that she&#39;ll most likely need some help soon. Areyja then began to move down the stairs, playing a light tune on her Bandore as she descended.<br><br>Stormfang told the party the message from Areyja, Kipna was the first to leave, being carried by Lil-kip. The rest of the party begin moving towards the tower. Cambyses planned on being the next one to be picked up by Lil-kip, once the owl had dropped off Kipna, but he was stopped. A familiar voice was calling for help deep within the building behind him. He turned around once he noticed that the other party members also heard the voice. The group ran into the sunken building, Cambyses calling out for where the voice was. Soon they all descended a metallic spiral staircase to a basement floor, with water levels going halfway up their calves. Smoke was billowing out of a room down the hall. Cambyses ran into the room to find his old acquaintance, Hodge. The human&#39;s leg was pinned under a large wooden beam in a burning room. After a confusing conversation Cambyses, with help from the party, lifted the beam off Hodge and carried him out of the supposedly burning building. They sat Hodge down as Cambyses found out that the human was created by an unknown spell. After a melancholic discussion Hodge began to disappear, the spell&#39;s time limit was finished.<br><br>Areyja rolled a 1 for stealth while descending the tower. Kipna was dropped off by Lil-kip at the top of the tower, most likely hearing Areyja playing music as she went down the tower.Areyja, as she traveled down the staircase, heard another instrument join in with her song. She soon got to the bottom of the staircase, seeing that she was underneath the field. The cave had little light and small islands in a lake of murky water. In the center of the lake, a large wildman stood, plucking a cello. Areyja approached and the two began to musically jam. A beautiful song was produced in the end and the two started to talk. The wildman&#39;s name was Marik, he claimed to have always lived in the cave with his “mother”. After he introduced himself as Marik, Areyja asked for his last name which he said he did not have. Areyja suggested that his last name should be Mercury, which he liked the sound of. Merik Mercury continued to answer questions from Areyja as Cambyses and Stormfang came down the stairs. The conversation brought up several details and information. Merik has never left the cave because his supposed mother said he should stay. His mother is a powerful magic user who created the cave and could even create animated plant life like her home, which was apparently a walking tree. Marik offered the party refreshments as Decax and Sander arrived. The water produced by Merik, using some kind of water bending magic, was very refreshing. As the conversation continued Merik was asked about a potential kneeling woman as “the master of the marsh” would know. Marik says that he doesn&#39;t know about a kneeling woman, though he seems to have lied. Cambyses, Decax, and Sander noticed a figure nearby. The three moved over to the figure to discover that it is a monument. Described as a life sized stone statue carved in the likeness of a kneeling peasant girl clutching a rose. The epitaph on the base of the monument read “Marina, Taken by the Mists”. It is noticed that there was a small magical presence in the base. Merik, despite the attempted distraction by the other party members, noticed the investigating characters. He moved towards them and told them to leave. The party refused and a fight broke out. Merik was discovered to be made of water and could animate the water into attacking party members. The fight ended with Merik being punched into oblivion by Decax. After getting rid of the animated water, the base of the monument was checked. Inside a small crack was a small amulet that was shaped like a sun with a red ruby encased in the center.<br><br><span class='text-black-50'>The amulet brings with it a question, <br> why would Merik protect it with his life…?</span>"

        "Content": "The party had gained a new artifact. The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind. Hadrian was given the holy symbol and Icon of Ravenloft due to his abilities as a cleric meshing quite well with the two artifacts. This had fulfilled what was found on the Enchanter Card given to the party by Azen Stormleaf of the Vistani. After leaving the swamp the group spotted a large ruined mansion on a hilltop. Ascending, it was found that the ancient ruin was home to a group of very depressed undead revenants, with their violent leader Vladimir Horngaard,. The party was informed by a nameless revenant that if the group needs to meet the leader they can meet with Sir Gwilym. Sir Gwilym was a tall half-giant warrior-priest of the Silver Dragon Argynvost. He informed the party that he and Vladimir are the last ones to even remember their names. Gwilym told the party that the mansion used to be owned by the late Argynvost who&#39;s magical power could create a powerful beacon of light for all of Barovia to see. Gwilym, after telling the party about the mental state of the revenants, Gwilym is offered to pat Lil-kip on the head. The revenant&#39;s eternal undeath was brightened for a brief moment because of Lil-kip and his soft feathers. The priest then told the party that if they returned the skull of Argynvost to the manor and reunited it with the rest of the skeleton can create another beacon which could weaken the Vampire&#39;s influence on Barovia&#39;s citizens. Before the party had left the haunted mansion they handed the Tome that they found in the swamp to Gwilym for protection. The revenants had never invited Strahd to Argynvostholt which allowed the manor to be a safe haven for the party and the tome. Gwilym was confedent that strahd will not be able to get the tome while it is in Argynvostholt.<br><br>Leaving the manor and deep into the forest the party encountered a lone wandering man. The Professor went up to the wanderer to ask them who they were. The man said that the lord of Barovia knows that they have taken his tome, and he demands for it to be returned. After telling the party the bounty from Strahd, the man suddenly transformed into his hybrid werewolf form. It was an ambush by a band of werewolves. <br><br>The lycanthropes had been told by Strahd to kill the party but after they put up a formidable resistance the fight ended. The chief lycan had been told by Stormfang that if he kept fighting then he and his band would die. The lycan had only one condition of his surrender, that he and the rest of his lycanthropes could take their dead away, the party agreed, against Hadrian&#39;s wish to kill the lycanthropes. Though the werewolves got to take their dead, the spellbook of their magic user was taken by professor wynather. After cleaning themselves up, the party finally arrived at the town of Kresk. At the front gate a woman armored in an intricate half-plate set was yelling at the guards to let her in. The party arrived behind her and were able to convince the guards that the woman was with them, after questioning her. The party then learned about the woman; her name is Ireena Kolyana, she was related to the Burgomaster of Vallaki and had escaped the town when it was being attacked. She was being called to Kresk after spending a considerable amount of time in the woods and fighting undead alone. The group splits into three groups; kipna and areyja head to the local inn to rest and eat while professor wynather and hadrian go up to the abbey. stormfang, cambyses, decax, and sander then continue on with Ireena towards a mysterious glowing pool at the north side of Kresk.<br><br>The professor and hadrian arrived at the front door of the Abbey of Saint Markovia, they were greeted by the malformed humanoid creature named Otto Belview, who had the legs and half the face of a canine-like creature. With Otto was the shy character known as Zygfrek Belview. The two were escorted to the front door where they met the Abbot of Saint Markovia. A young and elegant figure that welcomed them to the abbey, he then began giving them a tour of the abbey. Hadrian uses a detection spell and learns that the abbot is some form of celestial. The first, and only, room they arrived into was the main hall. The hall had a large table with a single veiled humanoid female sitting at it. She was swaying to the low ambient music box that was playing on the upper balcony overlooking the room. The abbot said that her name is Vasilka, and that she requires something. The abbot looks at the Professor and mentions that her face is what is required, as Vasilka does not have a face. Upon questioning, the abbot confesses that Strahd has trapped him in Barovia until he can make the vampire lord a bride and Vasilka is not his first or probably last attempt. The Professor declined the request for Vasilka to have her face, which the abbot tried to offer that he will give his ability to revive someone from the dead without cost. The two then leave after declining the offer. Hadrian then uses a spell of divination to ask the Dawnfather if the abbot&#39;s quest to make Strahd a bride will actually work; then a voice responded after a delay, “Only, if he succeeds will he die.”<br><br><span class='text-black-50'>All he need was a face... <br><em>So that he may finally die...</em></span>"
