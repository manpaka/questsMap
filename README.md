# The Quests and Adventures Repo
This is the Repo for the changes to the CCL subdomain that is planned to contain:
* Player Profiles (To avoid botspam on the forums.)
* An overview of the ever changing World Map.
* Basic public boards where Players and/or DMs can post:
  * recaps to previous sessions.
  * Help wanted ads (to attrach other players.)
  * Public Events.
* Some logistical data storage. This data will only be:
  * Basic Character Stats (Name, Class, Level, Ability Scores.)
  * Character's current Money and Magic Items.
  * Interactions. Like sessions a character has participated in and/or posts to the forums/discord.

If this becomes popular here are some extra ideas:
* Bonus Loot Tables
  * When a player posts a recap they get to pick some loot from a selection that is chosen based on their level and/or the quality of the recap.
* Dice roller.
* Initiative Tracker

This list can, and probably will, be expanded in the future as this website continues it's early development.
