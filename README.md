# The Quests and Adventures Repo
This is the code for a West Marches Campaign Website. If you find anything weird or wrong with the code, then just post an Issue onto the repo.

# To Do List
### Primary Tasks
- Add changelog page to website.
- Finish Rules and Guidelines on Website.
- Create Streamlined system to update quests and bounties without needing full website update.
	- Potentially would require log in and user data system.

### Secondary Tasks
- Get more quests and bounties added to the JSON files.
- Get some characters added to the JSON files.
- Find way to properly store images.

### Ideas and Cool Potential Features
- Add a "players joined" marker/system to the Quests and Bounties.
- Add a new page for viewing recaps and lore.
- Finish the Github Community section.
- Add a market for players to sell unwanted magic items for gold and such.
	- No real world money will be involved with this. That is just a stupid idea.
