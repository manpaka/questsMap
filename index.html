                                    On top of a hill the party was split into two, three were inside the hut with the other five outside. At a distance, a massive blue ring of ethereal fire surrounded the tree and party. On the outside of the ring, standing firm, were around two dozen ghostly apparitions. The tree, at that moment, did not seem to be that much of a threat. Inside the tree, in the hut, there were several notable items on a shelf behind glass;
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Large tome (which had already been grabbed by Stormfang)</li>
                                        <li>An acorn sitting in an egg holder</li>
                                        <li>Some random broom</li>
                                        <li>Couple heads and helmets</li>
                                        <li>A couple unspeakable items (too disgusting to describe)</li>
                                        <li>And, a small stone statue of an unknown figure standing in a flat pose</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    The tree had not attacked until Sander Rainpath grabbed the acorn from the shelf. This action caused the tree to retaliate by growing a long lance-like branch that pierced Sander through the chest at a violent speed, severely wounding him. The tree then proceeded to shoot more branches and roots with the same speed directly at the rest of the party. Some dodged the shots while others shielded themselves, Areyja soon became shielded by Lil-kip, who had already been using his wings to defend some of the other party members. Decax had tried to escape the tree only to find that the door had merged into the wall leaving them with no way out.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The most odd thing during the fight was that whenever the tree would move, the circle of fire would follow, this kept the tree in the center. The most worrying thing was that the ring of blue flame would shrink with each movement.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Decax started to stab the now false door in an attempt to break out of the hut in the tree. Meanwhile, Sander held the acorn grabbed off the shelf and he believed that it was important to the tree, then and there, he took his battleaxe and swung down at the acorn. Upon the acorn being damaged, the tree would take damage doubled. This action had made the tree become even more aggressive towards the party, especially towards the ones inside the tree. Stormfang started to attack the floor using the dwarven axe Hew, the floor was just the cross section of the tree and not hardwood panels. Learning this, Stormfang joined Sander and attacked the acorn which brought the tree to the brink of defeat. Utilizing several holes forming in the side, Stormfang jumped out of the tree. Then, with its final breath, the tree stabbed Sander Rainpath with multiple spikes through the body, knocking the Fibolg unconscious. What had dealt the final blow to the tree was the spell moonbeam cast by Decax. The tree had begun to fall apart and bury the hut inside of it, Cambyses ran into the hut and pulled an unconscious Sander out of it with Decax behind carrying the broom and Sander&#39;s axe.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The fight had drained the party but they had finally defeated the tree, as it collapsed into a pile of rotting wood and blood red sap. Despite the victory the circle of blue flame did not go away. The ghostly figures on the outside of the ring had now become properly visible, all of them were dressed in ruined plate armor and battle wounds. The ghosts were only observing the battle but it's unknown what they were there for. The party collected themselves in the blue ring and spent a couple minutes identifying the items. Learning that the acorn was a magical seed that would bring life to what it was planted in. The broom was just a normal broom. They also, discovered that Kipna has been carrying a statue known as the Icon of Ravenloft for some time now. After the discoveries, Stormfang started to read the tome that had started this. He had gotten to the end of the first half but was quickly interrupted by a loud guttural screaming sound. The ring of blue flame dispersed and the ghosts scattering into the ether, leaving the party in the dark. Areyja saw, at a distance, a wolf with glowing red eyes approaching the party. She informed the others and they all quickly prepared for a fight as Decax moved forward and was attacked by a number of zombies climbing out of the earth, and the wolf morphed into a humanoid form that was recognized as the vampire lord of Barovia, strahd. Strahd charmed a wounded Decax and began to approach the Tabaxi to stop him from reading the tome. Stormfang jumped onto Hadrian&#39;s flying staff and flew away but was interrupted as Strahd shot Stormfang with a fireball, injuring Stormfang but not stopping him. The party continued the fight but upon Cambyses taking the first shot at Strahd immediately killed the vampire. This action confused the party, until the vampire&#39;s body morphed into a common human and the zombies immediately fell apart. Both fights had really hurt the party, but the fight was over and they have been rejuvenated with the info they have been given by the tome they had acquired.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <span class="text-black-50">The party is now more powerful but the fight is going to get harder from here...</span>

                                                Cambyses, Decax, and Sander found themselves in a mysterious and dark land. After getting their barings, they walked up to a set of gates nearby and talked with the burgomaster of <strong>Krezk, Dimitri</strong>. told to go to the vineyard to see why there were no more shipments of wine coming into the village. If they discover what happened then maybe they&#39;d be let into the village.<br><br>The three go southwards to the <strong>Wizard of the Wines winery</strong>. They engaged a cult of insane druids at the winery, the cult had infested the winery with Blights using what is known as a Gulthias Staff. Soon the three were joined by an early arrival, Stormfang. After ridding the building of the blights, they noticed a larger force coming in from the south. As they prepared for a fight, Cambyses discovered that the staff, upon being broken in half, would instantly kill all blights within 500ft of it with an ear piercing scream. To which the Tiefling snapped the staff on one of the building roofs.<br><br>But while that was happening, something else was going on.<br><br>After a long journey five adventurers; Areyja, Hadrian, Stormfang, Kipna, Professor Wynather, and the giant owl Lilkip turned a corner to see the village of Krezk in the distance. It was midday and Hadrian&#39;s vision saw the unknown figures approaching the village in the evening. While moving towards the village, Stormfang is grabbed and carried away by one of the Wareravens they had previously met outside of Vallaki, <strong>Adrian Martikov</strong>. Soon the entire party was grabbed, Kipna jumped onto Lilkip mid-flight, and Hadrian had already started using his staff to follow along. The group was brought to a large Vineyard, known as The Wizard of the Wines. stormfang had arrived early to aid in the battle while the rest of the group had arrived at the very end, and there were some new faces at the vineyard.<br><br>The two groups soon converged and began had a discussion on their next course of action, along with a couple methods of taming the large amount of ravens in the winery. Hadrian soon flew off to tell the martikovs that their winery had been cleaned out, along with that he got some info about the Crawling Hut of the Witch, which he saw in the distance... Hadrian soon got back the group and they continue to talk about ravens, but they were cut off when they noticed that areyja was missing. They started to look for the bard, a couple of them noticed that she was out westward, running into the forest.<br><br>Areyja had seen someone she knew and began chasing after the supposed apparition. The party chased after her, except Cambyses who was helping the Martikovs with cleaning. Soon they stopped her deep into the forest, to which they saw an oddity, Areyja saw the instrument of her teacher, Decax saw the body of juice, Sander saw the ashes of the wolf snarl, Kipna saw the body of Lil Kip, and Hadrian saw a small meat pie. Stormfang and the Professor saw the illusion for what it was, a deep hole. Which closed immediately after the Professor poked it with a stick. Ending the illusion.<br><br>The party had soon gone back to the winery. Areyja was rather quiet for most of the journey, as Stormfang had aggressively held her back from grabbing the illusory instrument. There were now a couple options on what to do next,
                                                <ul><li>Go to the berez and look for a supposed item that can aid them in Barovia,</li><li>Go back to krezk for safety with a shipment of wine, or</li><li>Fight the wandering tree,</li></ul>
                                                The party then decided to fight the tree. (After a long conversation about raven taming)
                                                <br><br>They soon started their journey, Areyja stayed silent during this time, and Hadrian kept track of the crawling tree. The party then split ways with the Martikov wine cart and headed south east. After some time, they noticed that the tree was climbing the hill up ahead. They climbed the hill and soon saw the tree stop at the center of the grass covered hilltop. The group then approached the tree and saw the clearly lit front door, which Stormfang, Decax, and Sander immediately went into as the others stayed outside ready for a fight.<br><br>Inside the tree, Stormfang noticed a shelf with a large tome on it. He grabbed the book; the tree suddenly became active as the door slams shut. Outside of the tree, the party watched as the door slammed shut and the tree uprooted itself. As panic set in, a massive ring of red light appeared around the tree. Looking outside of the ring, a couple dozen ghostly blue humanoid forms appeared and low melodic sounds started to hum in the breeze.<br><br><span class="text-black-50">The night is setting in, and it will be a long night...</span>

                                        If you are not a part of this group, hello. This group meets every two weeks and plays through the D&D 5e module Curse of Strahd. The party is, in no perticular order;
