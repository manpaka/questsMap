                                    The party walked downstairs to check on Ireena but are sidetracked to the meeting hall on the second floor. They noticed that the room had an ambient light coming from it. Haunted violin music echoed down the halls. They detoured up the stairs to investigate the music and lights. They found themselves in a ballroom. The music, along with the light, was omnipresent throughout the room. At the end of the room was a rotten wood throne on a dias. As they explored Mordenkainen started to talk about how the music was familiar. He recognised it as music from his homeland, Orym. It was playing back when he had danced with the Duchess of Orlinen. It was specifically ball music that would be played during a masquerade. In a collective blink of an eye the room was different. Mordenkainen was wearing a puffy masquerade costume and a white porcelain comedy mask depicting a contemplative face. The room also had changed to look like a masquerade ball filled with unknown costumed party goers in the room, dancing to strange music. As the party looked around they noticed that each of them were also wearing masquerade costumes, almost tailored to them. As the group began to notice that it wasn&#39;t an illusion the room had quickly changed back to its original ancient dusty form. Mordenkainen, panicking, asked the party if they also saw what just had happened. They all agreed that it had happened and was confusing. Areyja was sad that she was not able to join in the dancing. Using a detect magic spell, it was found that the entire room now was filled with quickly fading magical transmutation and conjuration auras.<br><br>The party soon decided to leave the ballroom, get Ireena from the crypts, and leave the castle. After getting past some malfunctioning traps, they arrived where the invisible door to Mordenkainen&#39;s extraplanar mansion was placed. Then a distressing event occurred, the door was not there anymore. They noticed that one of the stained glass windows was also shattered. Looking outwards to the wilderness a new sight was beheld. What once stood the Village of Barovia stood a completely different town, bigger and boasting a sturdy stone wall around it. The town was larger and pleasant to look at, but completely different from the original Village of Barovia. The theory that they had traveled forward in time was suggested by Stormfang. The party decided to travel down to the town; while a couple quickly checked if the Vistani camp was still on the outskirts. The camp was not.<br><br>The party arrived in the farmland outside of the town, getting there using a couple fly spells and Hadrian&#39;s staff. They approached the town and were stopped at the gates by two guards. The party explained what had happened to themselves, which did nothing but confuse the two guards. They learn from the guards that the town is called Tellso, and that Strahd existed centuries ago until he murdered his brother and promtply vanished from the land. The country&#39;s inhabitants soon rid themselves of the old Barovia to remove the scarred legacy that Strahd had left. To show that what they had gone through was not a lie, Stormfang pulled out and lit the Sunsword. This sight scared the guards, who then mention that the Sunsword has gone missing from the museum in Carcos. Upon mentioning that the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind and Icon of Ravenloft, two important relics to the city of Carcos, have also gone missing, Decax suddenly began to glow. The glow emanating from the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind around the Warforge&#39;s neck. In a bit of quick thinking Sander charmed the recently arrived guard lieutenant, Edward, and had him let them into the city. The charm only lasted long enough for them to sneak into the town, Sander, after remembering that, suggested that when the group leaves they exit out of a different gate.<br><br>The party entered a tavern to find Ireena there, dressed completely different and passed out drunk at a table. She was in a haze and remembered being in the mansion one second and the next in the town and dressed in a completely different outfit. Her memories of Barovia were dreamlike to her and she didn&#39;t recognise the party at first. When she snapped out of her haze, thanks to Decax curing her hangover, she realized that the body that she is in does not feel like her own. She joins the party as they exit the town.<br><br>The party began to set out towards the city of Carcos. Decax was telepathically called by Kipna at that moment…<br><br> The Ranger had found himself in a wooded region. After regaining his barings, Kipna searched around and climbed the tallest tree he could find. At the top he finally recognised where he was, he was back in his home; though a bit far from where he was originally last time he was here. He saw in the distance a small city, which he recognised as the city of Carcos. He was only a day's travel away from the city and started moving towards it. Arriving in the city, Kipna determined that he could do some fishing while he waited for the others to find him. He reached out to Decax to find that the Warforged, who had been telepathically linked to Kipna, and the rest of the party were not far away. The others were only about three day&#39;s walk from Carcos. So, after informing the party of his whereabouts, Kipna headed to the town market to buy some fishing supplies. Carcos was having a spring festival when Kipna arrived, the market was packed with people buying and selling random items found during the winter; similar to a yard sale at the beginning of spring when everyone is done with spring cleaning. Kipna went to a couple dwarves who were selling fishing supplies. He bought a good quality fishing rod from them and, when he asked for bait, was directed to another vendor. The other vendor was also a wood elf. The vendor was selling various types of bait but also specifically enchanted pieces that would attract specific creatures. Kipna bought two squid, one pufferfish, one bulette, and one bear bait. He gave a tip to the wood elf and bid them farewell, as Kipna continued to explore Carcos, waiting for the party to come join him at the festival.<br><br>The group, now knowing that Kipna was waiting for them safely in Carcos, Up the northwest road.<br><br><hr><br>On their journey they noticed that they were near a familiar location. The hill where some of them had burned down a windmill owned by a hag coven. On the now grassy hill, instead of the ruins of a windmill, were a ring of standing stones. Exploring around they found that the area around these standing stones was hallowed and growing tons of wild strawberries and wildflowers. The party started to pick berries as they took a rest. While they were doing so, Areyja went east into the woods. She wanted to see if there was still something there.<br><br> Deep in the woods sat a massive stone disk. It was made of Limestone, many runes carved into the edge, and a large Y shaped crack across the center. As she investigated she felt a sudden twist in her stomach as every rune on the tablet changed. Stormfang, who followed her on Hadrian&#39;s old flying staff, headed back quickly to get the rest of the party. The rest of the party arrived and started to investigate. Then everyone felt the same feeling that Areyja felt as the runes changed again. Cambyses cast detect magic and found that each of the twenty six runes on the disk was made of three parts, creating unique magical locks. Three of said runes were missing. Each time Cambyses used an identify spell onto the limestone disk the spell would be redirected to one of the runes, where the rune would be explained instead of the disk itself. Every rune Cambyses identified contained a single element that his mind would refuse to process. After Mordenkeinen said that he had little idea of what it could be, it was concluded that the disk was a massive arcane lock. The lock itself supposedly binds some form of omnipresent entity to a single point, and three of the sub-locks were already broken. It was found that the crack in the disk was recent, no more than a week. As the final parts of the investigation were being completed a loud crack was heard in the sky and two runes vanished as two more cracks formed into the stone disk. The party then moved onward to Carcos.<br><br>Arriving in Carcos Stormfang, Mordenkainen, and Ireena sneak away from the party: though separately from each other. The party found Kipna at the docks, fishing with some people, and returned his magic items. The group rejoiced. Then realized that they no longer have any major obstacles left. The group heads to the closest magic shop to find some magic items. They find a shop called “Hiroate&#39;s magicks, potions, wonders, and low prices” <br><br>Stormfang, separate from the party, arrived at the museum and asked the greeter if they had any weapon exhibits. After mentioning the Sunsword the greeter mentions that the relic was out for cleaning at the moment along with a couple other relics. Stormfang headed into the museum and found the empty Sunsword exhibit. He talked to one of the staff there and eventually was told that he might want to speak to the museum&#39;s Curator. He agreed and was greeted by the Curator. Who, after having asked a couple leading questions, invited Stormfang to his office. Once there the curator asked for Stormfang to return the Sunsword, Stormfang pulled it out and the Curator offered him a deal. Either hand him the sword and he&#39;ll give Stormfang a reward for returning the relic, or he&#39;d call the guards and have Stormfang arrested for stealing a priceless relic of Carcos. Stormfang, though hesitant, agreed to the settlement of four thousand five hundred gold. He left the Sunsword in the office and walked out of the museum.<br><br>On the other side of town the party talked with a rather insane magic vendor named Hiroate Bymor. Hiroate offered to buy their magic items but was declined so he sold them several items instead. Upon leaving the shop a distant figure began to approach them. The figure was a human wearing a floppy brimmed burgundy wizard hat and carrying an open book. Decax marched toward the figure and shook their hand. The wizard was named Klaus Hydrin, another far traveler, specifically from the sword&#39;s coast. Klaus revealed that the party were not the only ones to have been brought to the valley by unknown forces, Klaus having arrived two days previously. He was cataloging everyone who had shown up to find a pattern. Klaus also told the party that he&#39;s helping out the local archive. Mainly because the archive burned down two weeks ago and lost all of their important records and maps. <br><br>The party is now in an unknown land with no method but hearsay to go by to navigate the land. Are they in the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, who knows? What was that limestone disk deep in the woods? Why are holy relics vanishing and randomly appearing in the hands of adventurer&#39;s from far off lands? And more importantly, why are people suddenly appearing from other realms and lands in this small valley? There are a lot of mysteries yet to discover. I think it is time for a new adventure. In the valley and beyond.
                                    <em><br><br>Five locks shattered, twenty one locks left. <br>When are all gone, my rule begins again. <br>It is thanks to you, that the king returns.</em>

                                                <h2><strong>I</strong></h2><h3>The Mad Mage</h3>Exiting the mountains with Decax, the party headed north and soon got to the base of Mount Baratok. Their goal, find the rumored mad mage of Mount Baratok. During the trek, a large pack of wolves was spotted in the distance. The group carefully avoided the wolves and continued northwards into the mist covered foothills. As they begin searching for the mage a storm begins to brew above them. Coming from the woods and standing on exposed bedrock stood a stag, lightning crackled in its eyes. The party faced the stag as it began to transform into a wild looking man with shabby hair with lightning crackling off of his fingers. When asked who he was the man responded with hostility and an accusation that Strahd had sent the party to kill him. The mage attempts to attack the party with several powerful spells. The party tried to calm the mage by saying that they are actually trying to kill the vampire. The mage did not believe them.<br><br>Soon though, the mad mage was restrained. It was found that the mage had cast a spell to stop his mind from being targeted by other magic. Cambyses realized that the only way to cure the madness from the mage is to use a rather powerful spell like greater restoration. Then the small red mote came to his mind, such an item had cast greater restoration before back in the Village of Barovia. Cam attempted to use the mote again, using this ability had a similar effect but a much stronger side effect of a spike in pain in Cam&#39;s chest. Outside of the pain, Cam&#39;s plan worked and the mage was cured of his madness. The mage, with a clear head, finally calmed down. <br><br>The mage then began to explain who he is, and what happened; the mage is a human archwizard named Mordenkainen from the realm of Oerth. He had come to Barovia to raise the inhabitants to slay and overthrow the vampire, Strahd. After a long battle Mordenkainen and Strahd began fighting at Tser Falls, which ended with the mage being struck, losing his staff and spellbook. The mage was washed away down the river, defeated. This defeat broke Mordenkainen&#39;s brain, he spent the next couple years wandering and hiding in the wilderness. Eventually, Mordenkainen turned into the Mad Mage of Mount Baratok.<br><br>With Mordenkainen&#39;s mind cleared of the madness, he tells the party that he has a place that he can hide them for a rest. The party followed the mage into the mountains to a secret door that led into a hidden demi-planed mansion. Inside the mansion the party took a rest, and as they rested Mordenkainen went to a separate room to clean himself up. When Mordenkainen got back the party asked him if he&#39;d join them to fight Strahd. The mage responded by saying that he will not join them till the fight with Strahd begins. Mordenkainen said that he does not want to reveal that he is alive to Strahd until the last moment. He says that they can go ahead to castle ravenloft without him and he&#39;ll meet them when they start the fight with Strahd. Then, after taking a rest, the party began a journey towards Castle Ravenloft.</p><h2><strong>II</strong></h2><h3>Journey to Castle Ravenloft</h3><p>The party discovered that there was a pack of werewolves in the forest. As they traveled, a pack of direwolves began to chase them. The group, not wanting to waste resources or time, started to sprint. After running for some time the party ended up cornered at the edge of a cliff in the forest. Being cornered and at the edge of the cliff, Kipna summoned the siblings of Lil-kip. Eight large owls descended from the sky and grabbed the party, with Lil-kip leading the owls out of the forest.<br><br>The party, on the back of the giant owls, flew towards the window to the crypt of Castle Ravenloft. Shattering through the ancient stained window into the castle&#39;s crypt. Inside the tomb, the group was attacked by a massive swarm of bats. Defeating the bats, the group headed deeper into the crypt to find the body of Sergei. Quickly enough, the group found a lone tomb. It was the tomb of Sergei von Zarovich. After grabbing the body, in a bag of holding, the adventurer&#39;s start to move back to the stained glass windows they had entered in from. But, something called them to find Strahd&#39;s sarcophagus and destroy it. Destroying the sarcophagus would stop the vampire from regenerating his body if he were to be destroyed.<br><br>Moving deeper into the crypt, and after dealing with a teleportation trap, the group found Strahd&#39;s personal tomb. In the tomb, they saw an ebony black sarcophagus with solid gold lining. Most of them chose not to get too close to the sarcophagus except Cambyses. The artificer chose to take the lid off of the sarcophagus. Inside laid the vampire lord himself, Strahd. At that moment, Strahd&#39;s eyes opened.</p><h2><strong>III</strong></h2><h3>The Crypt</h3><p>Strahd lunged out of the Sarcophagus attacking the party with his three vampire spawn. His methods for fighting were to strike the most vulnerable and then phase into the castle walls. Swarms of bats aided Strahd in the fight, many coming out of his sarcophagus like it was some kind of portal. Sander got the first hit on the Vampire lord, which revealed a terrible secret. Cambyses, being cursed by the red mote, had taken the blow instead of Strahd. Every landed hit on Strahd would never hurt him, only the Tiefling. Seeing this the party dealt with the other threats while going on the defensive against Strahd. They smashed the vampire&#39;s sarcophagus, killed his minions, and even forced his Chamberlin to retreat. But during the fight, a new friendly face apperated in the doorway, Mordenkainen. He taunted Strahd for his seemingly mistake of not killing the archmage originally. Mordenkainen then shot out a powerful lightning bolt towards Strahd, unaware of Cambyses curse. The artificer went down, taking all of the force of an archmages lightning bolt. Cambyses was then quickly brought back up by Decax&#39;s healing magic.<br><br>During the fight, Ireena became a target for Strahd. He closed in and grabbed her. He almost bit her on the neck, which would have surely ended her life. But Ireena was pulled back by a large astral hand that Mordenkainen had summoned. The adventurers then started to stay close to Ireena, to avoid her getting grabbed by Strahd again.<br><br>The fight continued raging in the crypt of Castle Ravenloft and the adventurers had begun to run out of options. The curse that had been placed on Cambyses, tying his life to Strahd&#39;s, made the adventurer&#39;s unwilling to strike the vampire lord. This was until Cambyses had an idea; the artificer would attempt to take the latent magical curse within him and try to bind it to an item, similar to his infusions. He used a large amount of his magic and ripped a small red mote out of his body and, upon placing it into a small gem he carried, crushed the mote completely. The action drained Cambyses, but it had an effect on Strahd. The vampire lord became more aggressive. Then, as Sander swung his glass greataxe upon the vampire, Strahd became hurt. What&#39;s more, Strahd could not heal while Stormfang stood by wielding the Sunsword. The fight turned against Strahd, he started to become more and more hurt, until finally…<br><br>The vampire lord fled. Phasing into the walls of the crypt and ascending the castle to regain some strength. The party chased after him by getting to the windows that they had originally entered in from. Kipna summoned another flock of giant owls and the adventurers ascended to the walls of Castle Ravenloft.</p><h2><strong>VI</strong></h2><h3>The Vampire&#39;s Fall</h3><p>The party flew into the sky on the giant owls. Soon landing on the ramparts of the castle. Guided by Kipna, who had marked Strahd in the fight, Stormfang dropped to a tower window to find an entrance to a supposedly inaccessible room. He found nothing in the supposed hallway that was supposed to lead. Cambyses had a different idea. The artificer went to the blank wall connected to the ramparts and blasted it open using two shatter spells, with aid from Sander. Inside the room was a small impenetrable adamantine structure filled with treasure, Strahd had fled once the wall of the tower, where the structure was. As they explored the wind began to pick up and the clouds began to darken.<br><br>The party moved around the ramparts until they found the main window of the main bedchamber. Stormfang smashed the window and the rest of the group walked into the bedchamber. After determining that the large rug in the center of the room was not animated or ready to kill them, the party began to explore the room. Then a set of heavy footsteps were heard above.<br><br>The party started to go back onto the ramparts. Stormfang climbed out onto the roof to find Strahd, standing alone in the growing rain. The vampire clapped slowly with a smile on his face. A bolt of lightning illuminated the roof and revealed that around Strahd stood multiple vampire spawn. The spawn then descended upon the adventurers.<br><br>Kipna, carried by Lil-kip, flew to a vantage point across the ramparts. The ranger also commanded his Giant Owls to help the adventurers fight the vampire and his spawn. The rain kept pouring down upon the group as the spawn started to swarm. Decax climbed onto the roof and was promptly ganged up on by four vampire spawn, but he held out by using the power of the Holy Symbol of Ravenkind to turn himself into a shining beacon of sunlight. That, added onto Stormfang&#39;s Sunsword, started to burn the undead all across the rooftop. Mordenkainen, seeing that Areyja and Cambyses were about to be pinned, cast a spell and the three gained the ability to fly. After flying low, to get a better angle, Mordenkainen shot out a powerful lightning bolt towards Strahd. The bolt phased through Decax, causing no damage to the Paladin. During which time Cambyses shot several pot-shots at Strahd, which annoyed the vampire enough for him to attempt a powerful blight spell, but he was counterspelled by Mordenkainen.<br><br>The giant owls had started to distract the undead, giving the adventurers openings to strike. One of said owls hit Strahd, which he countered by instantly striking the bird down in a single blow. Strahd got closer to Decax, and with his spawn, he was determined to take down the paladin. One thing that Strahd did not take into account though was Lightbringer, a morning star that Decax carried and was especially lethal to undead. Decax, with the force of divine judgment, struck Strahd in the chest so hard it had completely collapsed and shattered  the vampire&#39;s ribcage. The blow nearly killed Strahd, forcing the vampire lord to begin retreating. He crawled backwards like a four legged animal but did not make it far.<br><br>Areyja, seeing the explosion of divine power from Decax and Strahd fleeing, flew down to the vampire and cast a single spell. She whispered to Strahd, a whisper which the others could not hear over the wind and rain. The vampire let out a blood curdling scream, the vampire started to mentally experience all of the pain he had caused over the countless centuries. The vampire took his hands and clamped them around his ears, trying to block out the dissonant whispering. He started to scream louder as his hands tightened around his head. His hands kept tightening until his own skull cracked from his own strength. The vampire&#39;s head popped and his body fell onto the shingles, limp. The body, carried by the draining water on the roof, slid down off the roof. It cracked itself upon the ramparts and then fell towards the grounds of Castle Ravenloft. Strahd Von Zarovich was no more.<br><br>The remaining vampire spawn burned in the sunlight coming from Decax and Stormfang. Leaving behind only the adventurers in the rain. The rain started to clear and, for the first time at Castle Ravenloft in centuries, the sun parted the clouds and shined down upon it. The party got off the roof as Cambyses, still under the effects of a flight spell, flew down and dragged the vampire&#39;s shriveled corpse to the ramparts.<br><br>The party went back to the small adamantine tower and opened it up. Inside was a wealth of treasure that was unlike anything seen by them. Among the treasure were two familiar items, a deck of cards, and a small white metal rod that was previously carried by Hadrien Lumin.</p><h2><strong>V</strong></h2><h3>A Soft Epilogue?</h3><p>The deck in the vault became a problem quickly. As Decax and Kipna started to draw cards from it, Decax with 4, Kipna with 3. Then, after kipna got banished. Decax drew 2 more, while Mordenkainen and Lil-kip drew 1 each.<br><br>The deck in the vault became a problem quickly. Decax and Kipna started pulling cards. Decax, pulling four cards, started by pulling the High Priestess, which left no visible effect. He then pulled The Enamored, which made him enchanted purely by the visage of Kipna. The Recluse was then pulled, causing an incredible unknown fear onto Decax. Lastly Decax pulled the Looking Glass, a card that has a one time use ability that could give the user detailed knowledge of the larger surrounding area. Next was Kipna, who pulled three cards. The first card was The Hanged Man, again leaving no visible effect. Next was a card that he had planned for, the Bird. Kipna found himself two thousand feet in the sky. The last card, the Hermit, was then pulled. To the rest of the party Kipna never came back down from the sky. Kipna found himself in a lush forest, banished to another plane of reality. Decax, being panicked that the one he had become unwillingly enchanted by was gone, pulled two more cards in the hopes of getting Kipna back. The first one was the Hare, which increased his movement speed. The second was a card he was fated to pull. As a result of pulling the card he had caused the death of a loved one sometime in the past, present, or future. Decax had pulled Death. The giant owl, Lil-Kip, then pulled a card. He pulled Stars, a card that increased his abilities to new heights, though not enough to help him with finding Kipna. Lastly was Mordenkainen. The archmage pulled Rot and Mold, to which his only response was <em>“Oh, crap…”</em> <br><br>

                                            <p class="item-body">With the sudden loss of Decax the party had to figure out their next step. The next step that was decided was to continue on with their plan to travel up the mountain towards what they knew as the location where both Sergei and Decax&#39;s souls went. With Kipna&#39;s skills in traversing mountains and forests the journey was short. The group took the direct route through the mountainous terrain, at the highest point a huge creature was spotted in the distance, a Roc. Thankfully the titanic bird had not spotted the party, as it was quite distant. The party descended down the mountain with Kipna and Lil-kip keeping them hidden from the Roc, and finding paths to get the party down the mountain safely. The journey lasted only a few hours, it ended with the party arriving at the foot of a massive temple. The temple was carved into the mountain and measured over fifty feet in height. On the far left side of the temple was a large fissure that had formed, this fissure was what the party used to enter the building.<br><br>Inside the temple the party found that large amounts of the building was built from Amber. Inside a nearby hall there were three green flaming skulls, which the party decided to not fight. The party continued deeper to the center of the temple. In the central chamber, at the back are a set of double doors made of amber, on the sides are several halls, and in the center back of the chamber stood a large statue of a robed figure in a spellcasting pose. Areyja discovered that, in the entrance for the two side halls, are pairs of amber mirrors where their reflections would act irregularly. The reflections would wave and gesture for the person to not enter deeper. Not going into the main side halls, the party decided to investigate the two sets of double doors made of amber at the back of the central chamber. One set of doors had collapsed and led into an empty room. The other set of doors were locked with an arcane lock spell. With a clever usage of the spell silence and a strong barbarian, the amber doors were broken open. Inside the room were six large piles of treasure. As some of the party entered the room, a huge invisible force struck Stormfang. A massive invisible golem made of amber had been placed in the room to guard the treasures. The tough fight eventually ended with the invisible amber golem destroyed. The room was searched and many treasures were found. On one of the piles sat a gem encrusted skull, which Cambyses picked up. Upon picking up the skull, Cam was compelled to move to an unknown chamber in the temple. Moving through a fissure at the back of the chamber, Cam went up a large set of stairs and into an old library, whose walls were covered in ancient tomes. Cam went to one of the walls that was found to have a secret door, which led to a dusty but nice study. In the center of the study sat a headless skeleton wearing a torn yellow cloak. Cambyses was compelled to place the skull onto the body, against the party&#39;s better judgment. Placing the skull on the skeleton, Cambyses&#39; trance had left his mind, with him realizing that the skeleton might be a potentially powerful lich. The lich rose from the chair and thanked the party for their help in awakening them. The group then asked several questions and learned several things.<br><br>The amber temple was built by a group of wizards who wanted to seal away many evil entities and forbidden knowledge. Long time ago Strahd von Zarovich had come to the temple and made a pact with one of said entities, said pact leading to him becoming a vampire. In the temple sits many amber sarcophagi, each containing a powerful entity that offers powers to those who accept them. The lich has little to no strong thoughts on Strahd. The party also asked the lich who they are, to which they responded that they don&#39;t know. But the lich does know information on the amber temple, which they said that they can guide the party through the temple without getting attacked by the temple&#39;s protectors. The party asked the lich about the fate of the souls of Decax and Sergei, to which the lich responded that they would be in “collections.” The lich brought the party back to the central chamber in the temple. After showing the party some of the amber sarcophagi in one of the side halls, the lich brought them to a magically locked door that led to the tomb of the wizards who had built the temple. Soon the party was brought to one of the tomb&#39;s amber alcoves. In the seemingly empty alcoves were the souls that had been collected by the temple over a period longer than known. The soul of Decax was pulled out of the amber by the telekinetic hand of Cambyses, and returned to his body.<br><br>The Paladin, though quite confused, was brought back from his imprisonment in the temple. With that resurrection the Lich brought the group to one of the many vaults of amber sarcophagi. The three that were inspected each offered a dark gift. The Finger of Oblivion, The Power of Evasiveness, and the Gift of the HellHound Whisperer. Though the gifts were tempting, the group decided to not take them. The task of the Lich was done, at least to them, and with their memory returning. The group was then asked to leave by the lich.<br><br>The group started to leave through the exit and back into the snow, Decax decided to turn back and ask the lich something. The paladin&#39;s loud clanking had brought the attention of stormfang who had turned around to check on Decax. The two stepped onto the balcony to see the lich on the main floor, the figure that stood there had a green pustule covered skin growing onto the skeletal figure. A crown shaped form, made of skin and bone, grew onto the skull. The lich then began to float as their arms became outstretched to the sides. The large statue had changed as well, its pose imitating the lich. The lich, just before vanishing said “I remember…”<br><br><span class="text-black-50"><em>They have been reawoken<br>This will become a hazardous situation when they return...</em></span>

                                                A scream was heard outside of Madam Eva&#39;s tent. The adventurers rushed out and saw what was causing the commotion, they saw living shadows draining life from multiple Vistani. From the fire pit in the center of the camp a flame skull rose. The fight ended quickly with the newly given powers that the adventurer&#39;s were given. Stormfang, wielding the legendary Sunsword, used their feline agility to rush the undead. The fight quickly ended, with the undead being taken out quite quickly. Once the fight was over, the party had decided to get Kipna a magical bow from Madam Eva so that the Ranger could more effectively damage resistant creatures.<br><br>After a short rest at the camp, the party moved in the direction of the Village of Barovia. On the way there a ghostly yellow figure was spotted in the distance. Stormfang, due him partially recognising the figure. Moving forward to properly identify the elven figure, the Tabaxi became worried about who the potential ghost was. Once he got closer, the ghost was found to not be identifiable outside of the familiar traits that Stormfang could recognise. Before anything else could be discovered the glowing yellow ghost vanished upon a loud distant scream echoed out and was suddenly cut out mid scream without even an echo to say that it was there. Spooked, the party continued on towards the Village of Barovia.<br><br>Getting to the dismal village that sits in the shadow of the massive castle of Ravenloft. The group then headed to the local tavern to rest for the coming journey. Inside the tavern, the bartender Malik, was asked about a passed out individual in the corner. Malik remarked that the character was some drunk named Ismark, another outsider to Barovia who had come with a couple others. Ismark, who was shocked awake by a bucket of water, told the party that he was from Baldur&#39;s Gate and was supposed to join a small mob of villagers to go up to Castle Ravenloft to kill the vampire Strahd. But had not left with the mob due to him passing out from drinking.<br><br>A few of the party, Stormfang, Sander, Decax, and Cambyses, split off to go up to the local church and deliver the clothing they had gotten way back at the old bone grinder. They arrived at the old withered building they met with Father Donavich. He had told the group that it was a blessing that they killed the witches, but it did not change what the village people had done. As they were complicit in their kids being taken from them. After taking the clothes and promising to bury them, Father Donavich then asked Decax if they had any holy magic to aid him. The reason for the sudden question was that he needed someone with holy magic to cleanse his son Doru of an affliction he recently got. The affliction was vampirism. Father Donavich led the party to the chained trap door leading to the church&#39;s basement so they could potentially cure Doru. Cambyses, after discovering that curing vampirism required more magic than Decax had at the time, suggested use of a small magical item that he had gained when he entered Barovia with Sander and Decax. The bead itself could produce an effect similar to the spell greater restoration, but had another unknown effect. The four entered the basement and found a withered and starved vampire spawn. Using the Sunblade to prevent Doru from getting closer the group was decently confident that they would not be attacked as Decax prayed to his god. But what they did not fully expect was that Doru was starving. The vampire spawn jumped at decax but was not expecting that Decax being a Warforged did not, in fact, have any blood. As Doru grappled Decax Cambyses decided to use the red bead he was carrying. The bead disintegrated in Cam&#39;s hand and Doru suddenly burst into flame which did not burn the vampire. While the others were focused on Doru, Cam suddenly was hit by unseen damage which spiked his body. Stormfang held the Sunsword up closer to Doru to see if he would burn from the sunlight that the sword radiated. Doru did not burn from the sword which is what the group hoped for, the kid was freed from his vampirism and connection to Strahd. Doru was brought back upstairs. The priest is overjoyed to see the miracle that had been bestowed to his son.<br><br>As the group sat around Father Donavich and Doru, a slow clap started behind them from the front door of the church. It was Strahd von Zarovich, he had arrived to congratulate the party for their deed. As the others sat in front of the Donaviches, Strahd frustratingly admitted that he had not noticed that the party even had the bead. Knowing what the bead does to the user, Strahd said that he is tempted to test the effect the bead had caused, almost charging the group with his claws. But instead, Strahd retracted his claws and took a different approach. Strahd looked toward Stormfang and the Sunsword. He pulled out of his coat pocket a deck of familiar cards, at least to Stormfang it is familiar. The deck was the Deck of Many Things that had caused a lot of trouble for Stormfang and the ones he was with before Barovia. Decax, being curious about such an item, decided to pull a card from the deck. The card he pulled had a locked door covered in chains with Void written on it. The other&#39;s had barely a second to react as Decax collapsed onto the floor. Before the party could then attack Strahd in revenge, the vampire gave them pause as he admitted that he would reveal where the Warforged&#39;s spirit had gone. The vampire pulled a different deck out and pulled two cards out of said deck. The first card was the Tempter and the second was the Transmuter. The vampire sarcastically wished them luck before vanishing.<br><br><span class="text-black-50"><em>Another piece has been taken off the board. <br>He is out of reach, in a trap that will end this false adventure...</em></span>

                                                Areyja and Ireena were there in front of Strahd. The Vampire had an expression of death in his eyes but before he could strike the bard down he had a single offer to make. Strahd reached into his cloak and made his offer, Areyja would let Strahd have Ireena and he would not kill her or the rest of the party, he also pulled out a familiar lute in front of the bard. This lute was an item that belonged to an old mentor of Areyja&#39;s. Enraged, Areyja decided to fight the vampire due to his offer, and then the fight began.<br><br>The rest of the party had started to bolt towards Areyja as she backed away from Strahd and his spawn. They were not even slowed down by a massive minotaur skeleton that Strahd had created. Decax stayed behind at the tower to fight the undead monster, quickly destroying it. The party was fast, Stormfang sprinting with his feline agility and then jumping onto a wildshaped Sander. Though they were not fast enough, as Areyja and Ireena were alone in the fight. The bard though got aid from a new direction, Hadrian and the Professor appeared in the sky on Hadrian&#39;s flying staff. The two had begun to cast spells to slow the vampires, Hadrian using a large tidal wall of water and the professor putting a thick acidic gas around Strahd. These spells seemingly did not hurt Strahd himself, as his spawn grappled Areyja and Ireena, he then walked forward and put the bard nearly into the grave with a single swipe. Areyja, sensing her approaching death, casted a spell of flying onto her ally. At that moment, Strahd made his offer one last time. The Bard only needed to drop the spell and he would let her live. Areyja braced herself as she started to build her magic into a single teleportation spell to save Ireena; but she was interrupted though. A ball of sunlight had appeared in the sky above the fight, Hadrian and Professor Wynather had seen the opportunity to eliminate the vampire spawn and their master. The two took the chance and Hadrian used all of his dormant celestial power to create a beacon of light powerful enough to illuminate Barovia itself. Professor Wynather then enhanced the beacon of light with her own magic. As the two moved closer to Strahd, Hadrian said one last thing to the professor,<br><br><em style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;">“Sorry I couldn&#39;t teach you celestial,”</em> to which she replied calmly,<em style="margin-left: 20px";>“Don&#39;t worry, I think we will have all the time in the world”</em><br><br>The beacon of light descended down towards the vampire lord, as he screamed in pain from the light, a pair of giant wings appeared and engulfed him. Then a bright flash of light shot outward. When their vision had returned, the party saw only Areyja and Ireena left. On the ground there lay only a few items, the two artifacts that they had found in Barovia, and a pair of glasses. A bead of light was seen then entering the parted clouds and into the breaching sunlight. The party had lost two of their own.<br><br>After some time the remaining adventurer&#39;s left the peninsula and decided that it is time to seek out Madam Eva. They headed eastwards towards Vallaki but stopped short of the actual town. Ireena was from there and said that it was destroyed by Strahd and his vampire spawn. But the town was still there, seemingly untouched by the slaughter that had occurred a few nights ago. Cautiously, and after some scouting by Kipna and Lil-kip, the party elected to sneak around the edge of the town and not enter it. As they continued walking they soon came across a figure on the road. The figure was seemingly a dwarf of some kind, they were still in their slumped posture. Decax elected to go forward first. Upon approaching the figure he illuminated their face to reveal that it was the corpse of a familiar person, who had been lifted off the ground and impaled on a massive wooden pike. Decax dropped to his knees as the party asked him who it was. He told them that it was Thelkahm Glofdenn, the dwarf who had built him, his father. As he got closer to the impaled body it animated and began attempting to murder the closest figure to it. Decax did what he had to, as he pulled out his sword and slowly drove it into the corpse's body, smiting it and utterly destroying the magic that had animated it. They then buried the body and their hatred of Barovia deepend.<br><br>The party traveled far, passed Castle Ravenloft, and over the bridge at Tser Falls until they spotted a side road. Traveling down, in hopes of a quicker journey to the Village of Barovia, the party spotted a small campsite. The campsite had several carts and tents pitched up next to the river and a large bonfire in the center. There was music being played by the folk who were staying there, the music was played with an accordion. As they got closer a younger man, dressed in a brightly colored cloak carrying a long staff with a lit lantern on the end, called to the travelers to join in the festivities. It became obvious that these folk were Vistani, and that they held no ill will towards the adventurers. Several of the adventurers decided to join in the music, Areyja with her tin whistle, Sander with a ram&#39;s horn bugle, Stormfang with a Lyre, and Decax dancing along. Kipna laid down and took a quick nap on Lil-kip. The night was young and the time spent was generally uplifting for most. Cambyses asked the one who greeted them, who was named Owen, if Madam Eva was staying at the campsite. He replied she stayed in the largest tent there but was not ready for visitors just yet. Owen, after being asked about them, told the adventurers a couple interesting details about the Vistani. The most interesting detail was that they were allowed by Strahd to leave Barovia, but only the Vistani could come and go as they wished. The arrangement was allowed purely because they provided Strahd with information of the outside worlds. When asked about where they stay in the Swords Coast Owen reveals the most surprising piece of information, the Vistani have never visited Faerun and do not know what the Swords Coast is. But before further questioning Owen said that it was time for the adventurers to meet Madam Eva. The tent was entirely covered in furs, trinkets and many tapestries. The timeless woman behind the central table turned and told the party that she was expecting them, even though they were much later than she wanted. Stormfang mentioned that Madam Eva holds a sword of sunlight, she mentioned that if she did hold something that powerful she would not be too upset if the party found it in her tent. Though, Madam Eva had one condition, they are to trade something with her for the sword. She was then shown the letter that Stormfang and Areyja were given some time ago by Azen Stormleaf. She accepted the letter through gritted teeth, mentioning that Azen had passed through a while ago. Azen had a small potted plant with him but he was not let back into the campsite. So, the party began to search the tent for the sword. The party found many items of high value, but Eva would only let them take the sword. Soon though a lone platinum long sword hilt was found it was missing its blade. Stormfang being the one who most craves the power that it holds, having heard stories of such a weapon. The blade ignited in a brilliant shining length of pure radiant light. As everyone stared at the blade in awe a sound was heard outside the tent. The campsite was being attacked, but the party now had a weapon to fight the vampire.<br><br><span class="text-black-50"><em>Though they expect undead they will be getting something far more… malicious?</em></span>

                                                The four adventurers Sander, Decax, Cambyses, and Stormfang followed Ireena Kolyana to the pool in the small village in Kresk. She said that she was being called towards the magical pool by an unknown force. As the pool came into sight it was noticed that a storm had begun to brew. Ireena, after being asked about it, said she did not know what drew her to the place but that it had a familiar and warm sense to it. The group is observed as a spectral hand raised from the water, the hand beckoning Ireena towards it. She started to approach it, ignoring the worried questions of the other four. It became quickly obvious that she was not being enchanted due to some unknown forgotten memories. The hand raised more out of the water to reveal a ghostly figure, their body bearing long black hair and noble features. The ghost had a striking resemblance to the Vampire Lord of Barovia, but there was something else to this specter. Ireena, seeing the figure&#39;s true form, then started to sprint towards the specter, with full intentions to enter the pool and potentially drown. Stormfang, in a moment of worry, suspected a trap and stopped Ireena with his battleaxe, Hew. The storm began to hit the area in a thunderous roar with lightning striking the village. Ireena was not able to join the familiar specter in time and it sank below the waters as Ireena screamed towards it. An angry voice boomed from the sky screamed “No” as the figure disappeared under the water. The four did not have time to react to the voice as a massive bolt of lightning shot down from the clouds above and struck the pool. The pool&#39;s magic did not survive the lightning, and a small mote of light was spotted shooting up from the pool and into the skies, it then flew to the southeast towards Mount Ghakis. Ireena became silent while Stormfang tried to apologize to her, only for her to drop to her knees. Stormfang knelt next to her and could only ask,<br><em style="margin-left:40px;"> That was Sergei, wasn&#39;t it?”</em><br><br>Near the entrance of Kresk, Areyja and Kipna sat at the bar, drinking while Areyja played some music. The other adventurers had soon appeared as the rainstorm outside had begun to get more heavy and violent. Ireena was slung over Stormfang&#39;s shoulder, she had become despondent after what had happened. The fighter put her down onto a chair and again asked her some questions about what had happened. Ireena would not respond; then Stormfang went into a full inspiring monologue which ended with him telling her to get up and find Sergei. She finally responded and said that she has no memory of who Sergei is or why she is drawn to him. The night ended with Ireena joining the party to take down the Vampire Strahd. After that, in the nearby inn, the party began to take a rest and planned to leave towards the southeast to find Sergei. During said rest, Cambyses mentions a theory he&#39;s had, <em>"Potentially, when a soul dies in Barovia it does not leave into the outer planes but becomes trapped only be reincarnated in Barovia"</em><br>The party then rests fully; but before heading southeast like they planned, it was decided they take a detour and investigate a tower near lake Baratok.<br><br>At the foot of the large four story tower, it is found that the front door had no door knob or handle but a weird disc covered in several images. Cambyses noted that the images look like hand and arm motions. Upon doing said motions the door opened and they explored the tower, with Lil-kip flying up and landing on the roof. The investigation led to the top of the tower where the party found several things, a suit of magically animated armor, a warm metal stove, and a chest with a decapitated head in it. The head was identified as Azen Stormleaf, a vistani wandering merchant that had previously given Stormfang and Areyja a card reading that had aided them in the party&#39;s journey through Barovia. His head was perfectly preserved if a bit off putting. On the other side of the room it was discovered that saying a keyword, “Khazan”, near the suit of armor would bring it to life and follow the commands of the creature who had said the keyword. Stormfang was the one to say the keyword. As the party continued to explore the tower, several of them descended back to the third floor of the tower. This floor had a large whole in the side facing the lake and Ireena was sitting in the opening. Before something could be said, the tower creaked and a loud snap was heard; the tower was collapsing. In the moment Cambyses casted the spell Feather Fall to save the party while Areyja grabbed Ireena and used the spell Dimension Door to teleport the two to the midpoint of the road, five hundred feet away from the tower. Standing right next to the two that had teleported was Strahd von Zarovich, who was flanked by three vampire spawn. He had collapsed the tower, and had a look of rage in his eyes.<br><br><span class="text-black-50"><em>The lovers had seen each other again but sadly now… Strahd has come to claim his prize.</em></span>

                                                The party had gained a new artifact. The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind. Hadrian was given the holy symbol and Icon of Ravenloft due to his abilities as a cleric meshing quite well with the two artifacts. This had fulfilled what was found on the Enchanter Card given to the party by Azen Stormleaf of the Vistani. After leaving the swamp the group spotted a large ruined mansion on a hilltop. Ascending, it was found that the ancient ruin was home to a group of very depressed undead revenants, with their violent leader Vladimir Horngaard,. The party was informed by a nameless revenant that if the group needs to meet the leader they can meet with Sir Gwilym. Sir Gwilym was a tall half-giant warrior-priest of the Silver Dragon Argynvost. He informed the party that he and Vladimir are the last ones to even remember their names. Gwilym told the party that the mansion used to be owned by the late Argynvost who&#39;s magical power could create a powerful beacon of light for all of Barovia to see. Gwilym, after telling the party about the mental state of the revenants, Gwilym is offered to pat Lil-kip on the head. The revenant&#39;s eternal undeath was brightened for a brief moment because of Lil-kip and his soft feathers. The priest then told the party that if they returned the skull of Argynvost to the manor and reunited it with the rest of the skeleton can create another beacon which could weaken the Vampire&#39;s influence on Barovia&#39;s citizens. Before the party had left the haunted mansion they handed the Tome that they found in the swamp to Gwilym for protection. The revenants had never invited Strahd to Argynvostholt which allowed the manor to be a safe haven for the party and the tome. Gwilym was confedent that strahd will not be able to get the tome while it is in Argynvostholt.<br><br>Leaving the manor and deep into the forest the party encountered a lone wandering man. The Professor went up to the wanderer to ask them who they were. The man said that the lord of Barovia knows that they have taken his tome, and he demands for it to be returned. After telling the party the bounty from Strahd, the man suddenly transformed into his hybrid werewolf form. It was an ambush by a band of werewolves. <br><br>The lycanthropes had been told by Strahd to kill the party but after they put up a formidable resistance the fight ended. The chief lycan had been told by Stormfang that if he kept fighting then he and his band would die. The lycan had only one condition of his surrender, that he and the rest of his lycanthropes could take their dead away, the party agreed, against Hadrian&#39;s wish to kill the lycanthropes. Though the werewolves got to take their dead, the spellbook of their magic user was taken by professor wynather. After cleaning themselves up, the party finally arrived at the town of Kresk. At the front gate a woman armored in an intricate half-plate set was yelling at the guards to let her in. The party arrived behind her and were able to convince the guards that the woman was with them, after questioning her. The party then learned about the woman; her name is Ireena Kolyana, she was related to the Burgomaster of Vallaki and had escaped the town when it was being attacked. She was being called to Kresk after spending a considerable amount of time in the woods and fighting undead alone. The group splits into three groups; kipna and areyja head to the local inn to rest and eat while professor wynather and hadrian go up to the abbey. stormfang, cambyses, decax, and sander then continue on with Ireena towards a mysterious glowing pool at the north side of Kresk.<br><br>The professor and hadrian arrived at the front door of the Abbey of Saint Markovia, they were greeted by the malformed humanoid creature named Otto Belview, who had the legs and half the face of a canine-like creature. With Otto was the shy character known as Zygfrek Belview. The two were escorted to the front door where they met the Abbot of Saint Markovia. A young and elegant figure that welcomed them to the abbey, he then began giving them a tour of the abbey. Hadrian uses a detection spell and learns that the abbot is some form of celestial. The first, and only, room they arrived into was the main hall. The hall had a large table with a single veiled humanoid female sitting at it. She was swaying to the low ambient music box that was playing on the upper balcony overlooking the room. The abbot said that her name is Vasilka, and that she requires something. The abbot looks at the Professor and mentions that her face is what is required, as Vasilka does not have a face. Upon questioning, the abbot confesses that Strahd has trapped him in Barovia until he can make the vampire lord a bride and Vasilka is not his first or probably last attempt. The Professor declined the request for Vasilka to have her face, which the abbot tried to offer that he will give his ability to revive someone from the dead without cost. The two then leave after declining the offer. Hadrian then uses a spell of divination to ask the Dawnfather if the abbot&#39;s quest to make Strahd a bride will actually work; then a voice responded after a delay, “Only, if he succeeds will he die.”<br><br><span class="text-black-50">All he need was a face... <br><em>So that he may finally die...</em></span>

                                                The evening sets in as the party rests for the night. Upon the sun rising and poking through the clouds the party buried the bodies. The group had mourned the unknown dead and stayed in the field for some time. Investigating the area had shown that several stones and rocks around the field are tombstones. The field is an ancient battlefield turned graveyard.<br><br>They then decided to head towards the nearby ruins of Berez to continue following their lead to some sort of holy symbol. The hill descended downwards to a low marsh area with several ruins peaking through the heavily moss covered plane. Hadrian, Professor Wynather, and Areyja stay at the top of the field as the rest of the group heads down the hill. As the party starts to move onto the moss Stormfang, who immediately sinks into a hidden sinkhole. He becomes encased under several feet of silt and water and about to drown only to be pulled out from the sinkhole by the party. This showed the party that the field is covered in a large amount of hidden sinkholes that could result in a creature getting trapped under the ground. There were two buildings visible, half sunken into the moss field, a large building in the center of the field and a large tower in the distance. The group split into three teams; Stormfang and Kipna went to a small ruin nearby, Decax and Sander moved toward the large building in the center of the field, and Cambyses stayed behind to ritually cast the spell detect magic. Sander and Decax, while moving towards the manor, ended up finding themselves in a sudden sinkhole. Decax quickly saved Sander using magical grasping roots. Sander, being able to talk with animals, asks a small group of Skinks to help the two continue onwards without falling into any other sinkholes.<br><br>Stormfang and Kipna investigate a small ruin poking out of the moss. They discovered that the ruins, which are barely poking out of the moss, could be potentially over three floors tall. Cam stood nearby as his detect magic spell finished. During which Areyja came down the hill to meet up with Cambyses, Stormfang and Kipna. Areyja was pointed towards the tower in the far distance. She used her Fochlucan Bandore to cast the spell fly and she flew towards the tower. As Areyja was flying towards the tower Decax and Sander arrived at the large manor in the center of the ruins. The two then began to enter the building and saw, at the floor that they had access to, there was a noticeable water stream flowing downwards to a potential basement. Cambyses, after finishing his ritual cast of detect magic, caught up with Sander and Decax at the large building. The three entered the building. As they followed the flowing water stream, Cambyses smelt a familiar scent of smoke and entered a room that brought memories of his old life in Baldur&#39;s Gate. Cambyses ran out of the building into the open air, being followed by Sander and Decax. The three were soon joined by Stormfang, Kipna and Lil-kip. Stormfang had gotten a message from Areyja.<br><br>Areyja had arrived at the tower, it looked like a watch tower of some kind that had sunk several floors into the ground. Areyja, being able to fly, landed on the top floor balcony. She saw that there was a large nest with a single egg in the center. Upon inspection she concluded that it is either a Gryffon nest or hippogriff nest. She floated above the nest to get to the door across the room, along with grabbing a potion that was visibly sitting in the nest among other trinkets and bones. Before she began going down the stairs beyond the doorway she used her limited ability to cast the spell Sending and contacted Stormfang that she&#39;ll most likely need some help soon. Areyja then began to move down the stairs, playing a light tune on her Bandore as she descended.<br><br>Stormfang told the party the message from Areyja, Kipna was the first to leave, being carried by Lil-kip. The rest of the party begin moving towards the tower. Cambyses planned on being the next one to be picked up by Lil-kip, once the owl had dropped off Kipna, but he was stopped. A familiar voice was calling for help deep within the building behind him. He turned around once he noticed that the other party members also heard the voice. The group ran into the sunken building, Cambyses calling out for where the voice was. Soon they all descended a metallic spiral staircase to a basement floor, with water levels going halfway up their calves. Smoke was billowing out of a room down the hall. Cambyses ran into the room to find his old acquaintance, Hodge. The human&#39;s leg was pinned under a large wooden beam in a burning room. After a confusing conversation Cambyses, with help from the party, lifted the beam off Hodge and carried him out of the supposedly burning building. They sat Hodge down as Cambyses found out that the human was created by an unknown spell. After a melancholic discussion Hodge began to disappear, the spell&#39;s time limit was finished.<br><br>Areyja rolled a 1 for stealth while descending the tower. Kipna was dropped off by Lil-kip at the top of the tower, most likely hearing Areyja playing music as she went down the tower.Areyja, as she traveled down the staircase, heard another instrument join in with her song. She soon got to the bottom of the staircase, seeing that she was underneath the field. The cave had little light and small islands in a lake of murky water. In the center of the lake, a large wildman stood, plucking a cello. Areyja approached and the two began to musically jam. A beautiful song was produced in the end and the two started to talk. The wildman&#39;s name was Marik, he claimed to have always lived in the cave with his “mother”. After he introduced himself as Marik, Areyja asked for his last name which he said he did not have. Areyja suggested that his last name should be Mercury, which he liked the sound of. Merik Mercury continued to answer questions from Areyja as Cambyses and Stormfang came down the stairs. The conversation brought up several details and information. Merik has never left the cave because his supposed mother said he should stay. His mother is a powerful magic user who created the cave and could even create animated plant life like her home, which was apparently a walking tree. Marik offered the party refreshments as Decax and Sander arrived. The water produced by Merik, using some kind of water bending magic, was very refreshing. As the conversation continued Merik was asked about a potential kneeling woman as “the master of the marsh” would know. Marik says that he doesn&#39;t know about a kneeling woman, though he seems to have lied. Cambyses, Decax, and Sander noticed a figure nearby. The three moved over to the figure to discover that it is a monument. Described as a life sized stone statue carved in the likeness of a kneeling peasant girl clutching a rose. The epitaph on the base of the monument read “Marina, Taken by the Mists”. It is noticed that there was a small magical presence in the base. Merik, despite the attempted distraction by the other party members, noticed the investigating characters. He moved towards them and told them to leave. The party refused and a fight broke out. Merik was discovered to be made of water and could animate the water into attacking party members. The fight ended with Merik being punched into oblivion by Decax. After getting rid of the animated water, the base of the monument was checked. Inside a small crack was a small amulet that was shaped like a sun with a red ruby encased in the center.<br><br><span class="text-black-50">The amulet brings with it a question, <br> why would Merik protect it with his life…?</span>

                                                On top of a hill the party was split into two, three were inside the hut with the other five outside. At a distance, a massive blue ring of ethereal fire surrounded the tree and party. On the outside of the ring, standing firm, were around two dozen ghostly apparitions. The tree, at that moment, did not seem to be that much of a threat. Inside the tree, in the hut, there were several notable items on a shelf behind glass;<ul><li>Large tome (which had already been grabbed by Stormfang)</li><li>An acorn sitting in an egg holder</li><li>Some random broom</li><li>Couple heads and helmets</li><li>A couple unspeakable items (too disgusting to describe)</li><li>And, a small stone statue of an unknown figure standing in a flat pose</li></ul>The tree had not attacked until Sander Rainpath grabbed the acorn from the shelf. This action caused the tree to retaliate by growing a long lance-like branch that pierced Sander through the chest at a violent speed, severely wounding him. The tree then proceeded to shoot more branches and roots with the same speed directly at the rest of the party. Some dodged the shots while others shielded themselves, Areyja soon became shielded by Lil-kip, who had already been using his wings to defend some of the other party members. Decax had tried to escape the tree only to find that the door had merged into the wall leaving them with no way out.<br><br>The most odd thing during the fight was that whenever the tree would move, the circle of fire would follow, this kept the tree in the center. The most worrying thing was that the ring of blue flame would shrink with each movement.<br><br>Decax started to stab the now false door in an attempt to break out of the hut in the tree. Meanwhile, Sander held the acorn grabbed off the shelf and he believed that it was important to the tree, then and there, he took his battleaxe and swung down at the acorn. Upon the acorn being damaged, the tree would take damage doubled. This action had made the tree become even more aggressive towards the party, especially towards the ones inside the tree. Stormfang started to attack the floor using the dwarven axe Hew, the floor was just the cross section of the tree and not hardwood panels. Learning this, Stormfang joined Sander and attacked the acorn which brought the tree to the brink of defeat. Utilizing several holes forming in the side, Stormfang jumped out of the tree. Then, with its final breath, the tree stabbed Sander Rainpath with multiple spikes through the body, knocking the Fibolg unconscious. What had dealt the final blow to the tree was the spell moonbeam cast by Decax. The tree had begun to fall apart and bury the hut inside of it, Cambyses ran into the hut and pulled an unconscious Sander out of it with Decax behind carrying the broom and Sander&#39;s axe.<br><br>The fight had drained the party but they had finally defeated the tree, as it collapsed into a pile of rotting wood and blood red sap. Despite the victory the circle of blue flame did not go away. The ghostly figures on the outside of the ring had now become properly visible, all of them were dressed in ruined plate armor and battle wounds. The ghosts were only observing the battle but it's unknown what they were there for. The party collected themselves in the blue ring and spent a couple minutes identifying the items. Learning that the acorn was a magical seed that would bring life to what it was planted in. The broom was just a normal broom. They also, discovered that Kipna has been carrying a statue known as the Icon of Ravenloft for some time now. After the discoveries, Stormfang started to read the tome that had started this. He had gotten to the end of the first half but was quickly interrupted by a loud guttural screaming sound. The ring of blue flame dispersed and the ghosts scattering into the ether, leaving the party in the dark. Areyja saw, at a distance, a wolf with glowing red eyes approaching the party. She informed the others and they all quickly prepared for a fight as Decax moved forward and was attacked by a number of zombies climbing out of the earth, and the wolf morphed into a humanoid form that was recognized as the vampire lord of Barovia, strahd. Strahd charmed a wounded Decax and began to approach the Tabaxi to stop him from reading the tome. Stormfang jumped onto Hadrian&#39;s flying staff and flew away but was interrupted as Strahd shot Stormfang with a fireball, injuring Stormfang but not stopping him. The party continued the fight but upon Cambyses taking the first shot at Strahd immediately killed the vampire. This action confused the party, until the vampire&#39;s body morphed into a common human and the zombies immediately fell apart. Both fights had really hurt the party, but the fight was over and they have been rejuvenated with the info they have been given by the tome they had acquired.<br><br><span class="text-black-50">The party is now more powerful but the fight is going to get harder from here...</span>

                                                Cambyses, Decax, and Sander found themselves in a mysterious and dark land. After getting their barings, they walked up to a set of gates nearby and talked with the burgomaster of Krezk, Dimitri. told to go to the vineyard to see why there were no more shipments of wine coming into the village. If they discover what happened then maybe they&#39;d be let into the village.<br><br>The three go southwards to the Wizard of the Wines winery. They engaged a cult of insane druids at the winery, the cult had infested the winery with Blights using what is known as a Gulthias Staff. Soon the three were joined by an early arrival, Stormfang. After ridding the building of the blights, they noticed a larger force coming in from the south. As they prepared for a fight, Cambyses discovered that the staff, upon being broken in half, would instantly kill all blights within 500ft of it with an ear piercing scream. To which the Tiefling snapped the staff on one of the building roofs.<br><br>But while that was happening, something else was going on.<br><br>After a long journey five adventurers; Areyja, Hadrian, Stormfang, Kipna, Professor Wynather, and the giant owl Lilkip turned a corner to see the village of Krezk in the distance. It was midday and Hadrian&#39;s vision saw the unknown figures approaching the village in the evening. While moving towards the village, Stormfang is grabbed and carried away by one of the Wareravens they had previously met outside of Vallaki, Adrian Martikov. Soon the entire party was grabbed, Kipna jumped onto Lilkip mid-flight, and Hadrian had already started using his staff to follow along. The group was brought to a large Vineyard, known as The Wizard of the Wines. stormfang had arrived early to aid in the battle while the rest of the group had arrived at the very end, and there were some new faces at the vineyard.<br><br>The two groups soon converged and began had a discussion on their next course of action, along with a couple methods of taming the large amount of ravens in the winery. Hadrian soon flew off to tell the martikovs that their winery had been cleaned out, along with that he got some info about the Crawling Hut of the Witch, which he saw in the distance... Hadrian soon got back the group and they continue to talk about ravens, but they were cut off when they noticed that areyja was missing. They started to look for the bard, a couple of them noticed that she was out westward, running into the forest.<br><br>Areyja had seen someone she knew and began chasing after the supposed apparition. The party chased after her, except Cambyses who was helping the Martikovs with cleaning. Soon they stopped her deep into the forest, to which they saw an oddity, Areyja saw the instrument of her teacher, Decax saw the body of juice, Sander saw the ashes of the wolf snarl, Kipna saw the body of Lil Kip, and Hadrian saw a small meat pie. Stormfang and the Professor saw the illusion for what it was, a deep hole. Which closed immediately after the Professor poked it with a stick. Ending the illusion.<br><br>The party had soon gone back to the winery. Areyja was rather quiet for most of the journey, as Stormfang had aggressively held her back from grabbing the illusory instrument. There were now a couple options on what to do next,<ul><li>Go to the berez and look for a supposed item that can aid them in Barovia,</li><li>Go back to krezk for safety with a shipment of wine, or</li><li>Fight the wandering tree,</li></ul>The party then decided to fight the tree. (After a long conversation about raven taming)<br><br>They soon started their journey, Areyja stayed silent during this time, and Hadrian kept track of the crawling tree. The party then split ways with the Martikov wine cart and headed south east. After some time, they noticed that the tree was climbing the hill up ahead. They climbed the hill and soon saw the tree stop at the center of the grass covered hilltop. The group then approached the tree and saw the clearly lit front door, which Stormfang, Decax, and Sander immediately went into as the others stayed outside ready for a fight.<br><br>Inside the tree, Stormfang noticed a shelf with a large tome on it. He grabbed the book; the tree suddenly became active as the door slams shut. Outside of the tree, the party watched as the door slammed shut and the tree uprooted itself. As panic set in, a massive ring of red light appeared around the tree. Looking outside of the ring, a couple dozen ghostly blue humanoid forms appeared and low melodic sounds started to hum in the breeze.<br><br><span class="text-black-50">The night is setting in, and it will be a long night...</span>

                                        <br>
                                        This handy little website was made to easily show information to players that are not possible with Discord. The site can give you info on when the next session is, the last sessions recap, and any notable information.
                                        <br><br>
                                        If you are not a part of this group, hello. This group meets every two weeks and plays through the D&D 5e module Curse of Strahd. The party is/was, in no perticular order;
